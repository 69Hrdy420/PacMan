About project

I created this to improve certain skills - for example I tried to implement inheritance, also tried to play sets, maps and sfml in general. I didnt try to do everything the most efficient way. Sometimes I even experimented with few things just to see if they would work. 

It is also my first bigger project so if I would write this again, I would organize the code a bit differently. 

The project is not finished, because it took me a bit longer, then I expected and I want to have something that I can show right now. However I think it presentable at this point.

How to run

Project uses SFML library, I think you should be able to run it if you pull master branch and then just debug it at your PC (while having SFML properly installed).

I installed SFML with VCPKG. It is the simplest way I found. 
These are tutorials I used to link up the library:

    without VCPKG - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEiZalvDOj4&list=PL6xSOsbVA1eaJnHo_O6uB4qU8LZWzzKdo

I dont know if this is my problem or everyones, but I can not debug the same code twice with sfml libary. When I do, it tells me that some dll files are missing. To fix the problem, add comment anywhere in code (using //) to make it a bit different. Then you should be able to debug again.
